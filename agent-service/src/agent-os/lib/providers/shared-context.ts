/**
 * SharedContextProvider — the data-layer seam for the production merge.
 *
 * Every agent reads the world through a single `SharedContext` object. In the
 * standalone repo that object is assembled from Prisma/SQLite
 * (`PrismaSharedContextProvider`, registered in `src/agents/_shared-context.ts`).
 * When Agent OS is merged into the production AgentNexLiFy codebase, the merge
 * calls `setSharedContextProvider()` once at startup with an implementation that
 * reads from the production database — and nothing else in the agent engine
 * changes, because the orchestrator and agents only ever see `SharedContext`.
 *
 * See docs/INTEGRATION.md for the full contract and the production checklist.
