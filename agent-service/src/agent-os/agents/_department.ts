/**
 * Department-head factory (Agent Library v2).
 *
 * A department is ONE registry agent that owns a business function and dispatches
 * each ask to the best-fit internal *skill*. Skills are the former v1 worker
 * agents (src/agents/<id>/agent.ts) — their composing logic, trace honesty,
 * Authoring (no-placeholder) and channel formatting are reused verbatim; they are
 * simply no longer registered individually. The owner routes 1-of-8 departments;
 * the department then picks 1-of-N skills.
 *
 * Routing:
 *  - The orchestrator's classifier scores departments by the UNION of their
 *    skills' keywords/strong_signals (aggregated onto the department spec).
 *  - Inside run(), pickSkill() re-scores the same signals scoped to this
 *    department's skills and delegates to the winner's run().
 *
 * Channels: a department spans channels, so its declared `channel` is just a
 * representative (rich) channel for schema purposes; the *draft's* channel is set
 * by whichever skill produced it (each skill already calls finishBody on its own
 * channel, so the plain-text/no_markdown rule still holds on the real output).
