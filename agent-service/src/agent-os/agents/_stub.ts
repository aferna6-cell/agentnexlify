/**
 * Stub agent helper.
 *
 * Phase 1 registers all 18 agents so the orchestrator can classify against the
 * full library, but only the Generalist is implemented. Every other agent is a
 * stub: full, schema-valid metadata (so routing and the schema enforcer work)
 * with a run function that honestly reports it isn't implemented yet — no draft.
 *
 * Phase 2 replaces these stubs with real implementations, one folder at a time.
